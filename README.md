# goNNFS

## Introduction

`goNNFS` is a Go implementation of the concepts presented in the [Neural Networks from Scratch](https://nnfs.io/) book originally written in Python. This project aims to provide an educational resource for understanding neural networks by implementing them from scratch in Go, focusing on simplicity and readability.

## Features

- **Translation from Python**: Faithfully implements the Python examples from the NNFS book in Go.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to teach neural network fundamentals through hands-on coding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use `goNNFS`, you need:

- Go version 1.22.1 or higher
- A basic understanding of neural networks

### Installation

Clone the repository and build the project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d0tiKs/goNNFS.git
```

Explore the different go files to check the implementation.
